### Data for plotting R1 scaling curve
1. `bash scripts/r1/batch_pass_at_k.sh`
2. Step through `break_into_meta_steps.ipynb`, with the appropriate `output_dir`, `max_steps`, and `group_size`.
    2.1 `max_steps` is the number of episodes at which we stop breaking the response into further episodes (in our paper, we picked `max_steps = 49` for the Omni-MATH subset and `max_steps = 45` for AIME 2024).
    2.2 `group_size` controls how many episodes are grouped together (in the paper, 5 for Omni-MATH, 3 for AIME 2024).
3. `bash scripts/r1/batch_pass_at_k_given_prefix.sh`

### Data for plotting direct curve
1. `bash scripts/r1/batch_pass_at_k_direct.sh`

### Plot
1. Step through `episode_scaling_curve.ipynb` with the appropriate `output_dir`

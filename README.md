# Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Finetuning

This repository contains the code for our paper titled "Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Finetuning." In this work, we introduce a novel approach to optimizing test-time compute through meta reinforcement learning, aiming to balance the efficiency and discovery capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
